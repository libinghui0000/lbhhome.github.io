My name is Binghui Li. I am a senior undergraduate at [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), Peking University, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). I am also pleased to have worked closely with [Prof. Yuanzhi Li](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuanzhil/) and [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/). My research area is machine learning, with special interests in understanding deep learning and algorithms inspired by theoretical insights. 
If you are interested, please feel free to contact me!

I will join [CMLR](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/About/Introduction/index.htm) in Fall 2023!
